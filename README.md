# CNN
Low level python implementation of a neural network for learning purposes

-------------------------USAGE-------------------------------
In network.py, there are several comment blocks detailing
the usage of each set of classes. networktest.py has 
example networks set up for you to use.

-------------------------NOTE--------------------------------
This network was used primarily as a learning experience, 
following (more or less) the tutorial written by Michael 
Nielsen on neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.net. As such, it
has not been optimized for performance. The Convolution and 
Pooling layers are especially slow. 

If you are looking for an example to help you better
understand how neural networks function, then by all means
feel free.

For actual training and experimentation however, I would
advise you to use libraries such as tensorflow, pytorch, or 
keras, to name a few (I think they're called wrapper 
libraries).
